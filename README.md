ATLAS WARRIORS REDUX
(c) 2017 Lachlan Kingsford

This is the essential version 2 of Atlas Warrors. The initial version was in
Python and ended up not quite being finished. It was an utter mess of code.
The initial goal of this project is to at least recreate Atlas Warriors in 
a more expandable way, with neater and more expandable/maintainable source.
